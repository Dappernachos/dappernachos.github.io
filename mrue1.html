Female. 15. High school freshman. American. Flowy long gold-brown hair I often don’t bother brushing. Blue eyes. Pale skin. A rather average figure, if not just a little chubby. Blood type B. </span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span><i>No, that’s not it.</i></span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>My father, an engineer, is from Colorado, but my mother, a teacher, was born and raised here in California. My dad always comes home covered in grime, lighting up when explaining the machinery he got to work on that day. My mother likes to complain about the education system and how poorly teachers are paid. Both of my parents have always been there for me and willing to help. My best friend is a tall guy named Jason. He always has a bright air to him, even though he constantly makes jabs at me. </span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span><i>Hmm…</i></span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>In second grade I almost died to a rare disease. They used me as a test for its treatment, which thankfully worked. I met Jason in fifth grade when he messed up on a school play and ad-libbed his way out of the scene, and I teased him for it. My grandfather passed away when I was eight, and my soon to be born brother claimed his name. One time in middle school I skipped school to go to some shabby party. In first grade I had a friend who would talk nonstop, and I would hear her out every time as to not dishearten her.</span></p><p>&nbsp; <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t know...</i></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>I’m generally a quiet girl, not that I’m nervous or anything. I just generally find conversation pointless. I most prominently spend my free time browsing the internet. I simply observe old forum posts or comments sections, rarely participating myself. When I’m not doing that, I occasionally like sitting down to read a good book. Sometimes I get pretty depressed, but who doesn’t nowadays anyway? At least out of peers. I’d say in general my problems aren’t nearly as severe as most people around me, but that doesn’t stop me from getting down now and then. I don’t do too well in school. I sometimes have trouble with zoning out.</span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>“Kelsie?”</span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>I snap out of it and readjusted my large round glasses. “Yes? Oh, right…”</span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>“Can you tell us a fun fact about yourself? It will help me with remembering your name.”</span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>“Right. I…”</span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span><i>Think, think…</i></span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>“I prefer cats to dogs.” A few murmurs break out among the class, whisperings of debate, punctuated by some chuckles. My thoughts really went on a tangent there. I should have just said something to get the class moving and attention off of me, as I eventually did. Either way, I could now go back to the realm of my thoughts, uninterrupted until every student had said their piece. </span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>I guess I’m really not special at all.</span></p><p><span><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span></span></p><p><span><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span></span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“So how’s it kickin’ chicken?” </span></p><p><span><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span></span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I looked up at the boy who followed by my side while soft wind touched my skin as we stepped out the door of the school. It was my friend, Jason. We’ve both walked home since middle school, so we usually walk together until we have to part ways. “I figured high school would be different from middle school, but so far nothing has really changed. Not the teachers or the students.”</span></p><p><span><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span></span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Yeah, I guess. Good thing we have different classes and lunches, though. I’ve been wanting to get rid of you, and I’ve already made new friends to replace you,” he muses. I knew I could count on him making friends on the first day. </span></p><p><span><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span></span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“Oh come on, you know I’m irreplaceable. I’m a valuable asset.”</span></p><p><span><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span></span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“True, true. I still have experiments to test on you. For the next one, I’m throwing you in a pool of sharks.” </span></p><p><span><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span></span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;He manages to raise a slight laugh out of me. “That’s hardly an experiment.”</span></p><p><span><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span></span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“We still have much to learn about shark behavior. Like how they interact with losers who don’t have a life to take in the first place.” </span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>“I’ll pass.”</span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>His grin shifts to one side. He snatches my glasses and puts them on. “Sometimes you need to take experiments into your own hands.” </span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>“Oh, give them back!” I say between giggles, reaching out my arm for them, which he wards with his own.</span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>“Actually take these back. I can’t see through them.” He returns them. By now my face is already as red as a clown’s nose. “I suppose I truly cannot replace you, even with myself. Shame.”</span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>We walk a while longer. I stop at the corner where we typically separate, remembering something. “We’re going to go hang out with Connie and Jenna on Saturday, right?”</span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>“Oh shoot, that’s right. Where are we going again?”</span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>“We were deciding between Rodney’s Diner or the zoo,” I recall. “The others said they didn’t care which one, and I can’t decide either.”</span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>“Well either is fine with me. I guess it’s up to you.”</span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>I think about it for a few seconds. I remove my backpack (which is a shame, because I usually like to wait until I get home so I can slip both arms out at once and let it fall to the floor. It’s really satisfying) and unzip the smallest flap. From it I produce my wallet and withdraw a quarter. “I’ll just flip this coin. What’s heads?”</span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>“Diner.”</span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>“Alright.” I flick the coin and watch it glimmer from the light of the evening sun. I am suddenly overcome with an inexplicable sense of despair, as if the result of the coin flip was deciding my destiny or something like that. As time moves in slow motion, I calm myself in that moment. This isn’t that big of a deal. But why do I feel like it is…? </span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>I hold my breath before the coin hits the ground. </span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>… </span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span><i><b>TING</b></i></span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Nausea takes over my body and mind. My head begins to spin and it feels like the world around me is falling apart. I clutch my heart and fall to my knees. My eyes dart around frantically, trying to lock onto something, but everything is melting and melding into one homogenous soup. </span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>“sie”</span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>What?</span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>“els”</span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>What is this sound?</span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>“Kelsie?”</span><span>
</span><span><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span></span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I gasp. I place my hand on my head. The twisting and turning world emerges back into my senses. I hear the voice: “Kelsie? Are you alright?” I turn to face the voice and in front of me is a Picasso painting. Its proportions shift until it takes form. Jason.</span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>“I… think so.”</span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>“What just happened?”</span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>“I’m not sure… I think I was hallucinating or something.” It is unusual seeing Jason with an uncharacteristically serious expression.</span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>“Maybe we shouldn’t go after all,” Jason suggested disconcertedly. </span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>“No!” I shout a little louder than I had intended to. “...I’ll &nbsp;be fine.”</span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Jason raises an eyebrow. “Okay. Just holler at any of us if you change your mind. </span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>“Right. Well, see you there!” I pick up my backpack and make a sharp turn and wave back him without looking. When I get home I quickly make my way to my room, stealthily avoiding my parents who will probably chew me out for something I missed or forgot about. I instantly bury myself in a book. Soon I zone out and my mind wanders to what had happened earlier. What exactly was that? I have not experienced anything like it before. Did somebody slip hard drugs into my orange juice?</span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Then I remember that I forgot to look at the quarter. </span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>What was on it, dammit?</span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>I decide to text Jason to ask him. </span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Ten minutes:</span><span> No response.</span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>One hour:</span><span> No response.</span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>The rest of the night</span><span>: No response.</span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>I get a little antsy. Why isn't he responding? He’s normally rather quick to reply. Then again, maybe something’s happening on his end with family or something. Right now my eyelids are heavy and I’m obliged to give them what they want.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>The following day, Jason doesn’t show up at any time during school.</span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>I wait for him outside the door to walk home. My heart sinks for a moment. I still haven’t received a reply from him. I sent more texts asking where he was, met no results. After twenty minutes of waiting, I depart. My mind wanders to the many possibilities. I sweep them away and out of my mind. I’m sure nothing bad happened to him. </span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>I find myself at the corner. For a moment I consider going to his house to see if he is there and clear any worries I have. I linger at that corner for a few minutes while considering my option, but eventually I push my emotions away and turn to route that will lead me home.</span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>But something compels me. I suddenly find myself moving the other way. I’m panting. Why am I sprinting? I feel so hot. Why do I get the sense that something happened? I have no basis to go off of for that! And yet… </span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Knock. Knock. </span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>I hear a muffled voice. “I’ll get it,” it says. The door creeps open. It’s a slightly aged woman. “Oh? Are you one of Jason’s friends? Is something wrong?” I realize that I look like I’m in shambles. Breathing heavily, reddened skin, disheveled hair. I run my fingers through my hair to straighten it and push my glasses up in an attempt to regain my composure. </span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>“Where has Jason been? He wasn’t at school,” I tell her. </span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>“Hey, is that Kelsie?” I hear a male voice call out from inside. “Let her in please, it’ll just be for a moment.”</span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>“Sure! No problem!” The woman made way and I entered. The inside of the house appeared weirdly ramshackle. The walls looked worn and the tiles were cracked and starting to break off. Laying on a crimson couch, it was him.</span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>“Yo,” he calls. A sense of relief makes its way through my body. </span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>I stumble over to him. “Hey, where have you been? I tried texting you but got no response.”</span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>“Oh, yeah. I was sick earlier today so I didn’t go to school.”</span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>“You sure you weren’t slacking?” I quip.</span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>“No reason to slack as of yet.” His frank response elicits a suspecting reaction from who I assume is his mother. He gestures it away. “Yeah, also my phone broke last night.”</span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>“Oh. That sucks,” I tell him, when in truth I was more relieved than sorry. I remember the reason I was trying to contact him and pull myself together. “I meant to ask you, what did the coin land on yesterday? I forgot to check.”</span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>“Classic Kelsie, what a slacker.” I shoot him a joking glare and he continues. “It was heads, so the diner.”</span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>“Thanks” is all I can think to say. “See you there.” He returns the gesture and I exit. On my way back I open my phone and inform my other friends about where we are going. They had bugged me all day but I had no answer. </span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>When I get home I slip my backpack off and stretch my arms before playing trust fall with my bed. It has yet to fail me.</span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Suddenly something arises within me. I feel my limbs shaking violently as my senses are hijacked by enigmatic nausea. </span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Wait.</span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>This is the same as yesterday.</span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>It feels like my insides are heating up.</span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>No.</span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>This is worse than yesterday.</span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>The world dissolves and my consciousness begins to slip away from my body. I’ve lost touch with reality. My bed is gone. My room is gone. This world is gone. All that is left is a bizarre emotion I cannot describe. I am floating in a void, formless. </span></p><p>&nbsp;<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Who am I?</span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>My senses slowly return. My blurry vision begins to sharpen. I can make out some shapes. Then </span><span>it</span><span> appears. A mortifying face that would forever be burned into my memory. Its eyes were sunken and blood red. Its menacing smirk spread unnaturally far across its face, baring blade-sharp teeth. All of its features were obscured in some areas by its draping maggot-white hair. </span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>I blink. It’s gone. My eyes have fully adjusted. In the thing’s place is a softer face with rounded, inviting features. Fluffy long hair reminiscent of snow piled at the side of the road, large eyes, a welcoming smile. </span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>I examine the face and soon realize its resemblance to the creepier one I saw. It even has red eyes, although now it is only in its irises and it doesn’t appear threatening. Did it just look that way because it was blurred? No, it can’t be. The features don’t quite align. Especially the hair, which was now to the sides instead of going over the face. Was my mind fooling me? I guess I am a little tired… </span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Come to think of it, the face no longer oppressed my entire vision. It was pulled back, and it belonged to a young boy in white robes that appeared rather large for him. I initially didn’t notice because all my surroundings are white. I look around. It looks like a doctor’s office that had been moved out of and abandoned. There was nothing in it other than the cloudlike couch I now sat on. It is almost surreal.</span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>“Hiya!” a voice suddenly calls to me as I am examining the couch. I jerk my head to see the kid. He has his eyes closed, slanted in a friendly way. “Kelsie, was it? Well I’m Cipher! You can call me that, at least.” He gleefully skips his way over to me and extends his hand.</span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>I feel a bead of sweat run down the side of my face. “How… How do you know my name?”</span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>“I’ve been raring to meet you in person!” He ignores the question. I apprehensively take my hand and he shakes it violently as a kid would. Wait, what kind of name is ‘Cipher’? </span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>“Um… that’s nice, but who are you exactly?”</span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>“You don’t know how difficult it’s been watching you but being unable to confront you. But I finally got permission!” Something about this kid seems off to me. I mean, besides the obvious. It’s like my mind is sending me signals to run… or to crumble to my knees and accept it.</span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span><i>Accept what?</i></span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>The boy backs off and does a twirl of enthusiasm. “So, how does it feel, being here at last?” That voice. At first I thought it was simply cheerful, but it’s almost like there is an underlying apathy. The way he extends words but doesn’t shift the pitch. I think that was it.</span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>“Look, can you just tell me what’s going on?” A pang of irritation is now present in my voice. </span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>“Oh, bummer,” Cipher replies. “I was having fun keeping it vague. I’ve just always imagined myself in this position and now that I got it I really want to live it, you know?” I shoot him a pissed off expression. He curls into an almost comical frightened pose. “Yikes! Oh, well. I suppose I’ll have to tell you. You see, you’ve been given a rather unique opportunity!”</span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>I lean in, keenly focused on his words.</span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>“</span><span><b>You</b></span></p><p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>will</span></b></p><p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>get</span></b></p><p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>to</span></b></p><p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>determine</span></b></p><p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>the</span></b></p><p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>past, </span></b></p><p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>present, </span></b></p><p><b><span><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span></span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;and</span></b></p><p><b><span><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span></span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;future</span></b></p><p><span class="Apple-tab-span"><b> </b></span><b>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;of your world.</b>”</p><div><span>
